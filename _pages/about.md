Tiffany is a dynamic and creative student with a strong passion for **cultural expression**, **community engagement**, and **social impact**. With over 13 years of training in **Ballet**, **Classical Chinese dance**, and **Modern dance**, I'm currently pursuing additional certification through the **Arts Unionville Dance Program** at Unionville High School in Ontario. I share my cultural heritage through performance, blending tradition with storytelling, and frequently performs at multicultural festivals and community events.

Beyond the performing arts, I'm actively involved in **non-profit organizations**. I have served as both **Sponsorship Coordinator** and **Outreach Executive**, where I contributed to event planning, sponsor outreach, logistics, and day-of execution. My responsibilities included researching and contacting potential sponsors, developing sponsorship packages, and helping secure financial and in-kind support to ensure successful events.

I also actively participates in her school’s **Model United Nations (Model UN) Club**. I took part in the **Toronto Model UN Conference**, where I represented various countries in formal UN simulations, debated global issues, and honed her skills in diplomacy, public speaking, and negotiation.

In addition, Tiffany is a dedicated member of the **Mock Trial Club**, where I participates in simulated courtroom trials. I has collaborated with peers to prepare case materials, construct legal arguments, and role-play as attorneys and witnesses. Through these experiences, I have developed a foundational understanding of legal processes, courtroom etiquette, and critical reasoning.

Tiffany also expresses her creativity through **baking and cooking**, often contributing to **charity bake sales** and **school fundraising events** that support meaningful causes.

Her commitment to **giving back** is evident through her ongoing volunteer work at **local festivals**, **community events**, and with **charities supporting sick and hospitalized children**.

Tiffany’s curiosity and dedication to academic growth have led her to **research opportunities** in both **social science and psychology**. I collaborated with a University of **Toronto professor** on a research project that involved literature review, survey design, and data analysis focused on adolescent health and cross-cultural education.

In **Summer 2024**, Tiffany attended the **Brown University Pre-College Program** in Leadership and Social Change, where I completed an independent social science research project titled:
**“The Lack of Cultural Awareness in Markham: Challenges and Opportunities for Youth Engagement.”**
Supervised by a Brown University assistant professor, the project explored the effects of cultural disconnect among youth in one of Canada’s most diverse cities and proposed actionable solutions to enhance cross-cultural understanding and inclusion.

In **Summer 2025**, Tiffany was selected to participate in **Shad York**, a nationally recognized **Shad Canada enrichment program** focused on **STEAM**, **entrepreneurship**, and **leadership**. As part of the program, I co-developed an **innovation prototype** called **ICELERT**, designed to detect and alert drivers of icy road conditions to help prevent traffic accidents. I contributed to both the technical concept and business planning process.

Tiffany also played a leading role in planning and hosting Shad York’s **Open Day Celebration** and **Evening Variety Show**. As one of the **Masters of Ceremonies (MCs)**, I introduced speakers and performers, engaged the audience, and ensured the smooth flow of the events through coordination and stage management.

Her academic interests span **political science**, **psychology**, **economics**, and **law**, reflecting a long-term goal of understanding how **human behavior and governance intersect** to create meaningful and lasting societal change.

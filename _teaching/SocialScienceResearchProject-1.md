**Project Topic:** The Lack of Cultural Awareness in Markham: Challenges and Opportunities for Youth Engagement
<br><br>**Project Background**
<br>This project addresses the ongoing issue of anti-Asian hate and cultural misrepresentation, particularly in the context of Chinese identity and youth experience. While anti-Asian racism became more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, its roots run deep, dating back to the 19th century with discriminatory laws, exclusion acts, and violent events such as the 1871 Los Angeles Chinese Massacre. In both the United States and Canada, Asians have historically been marginalized, denied basic rights, and subjected to physical violence and systemic exclusion.

Despite progress over time, racism and cultural disrespect persistâ€”especially in educational and social environments. As a Chinese Canadian student, I has personally experienced discrimination and mockery, including being targeted with racial slurs and ridiculed for wearing traditional clothing. These painful moments became the catalyst for selecting this issue as the focus of a social action project. The goal is to raise awareness, promote cultural representation, and create space for youth to feel proud of their heritage while actively combating prejudice in their communities.

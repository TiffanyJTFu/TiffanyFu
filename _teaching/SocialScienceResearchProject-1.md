**Project Topic:** The Misrepresentation of Chinese Culture: A Youth Perspective on Anti-Asian Racism and Cultural Identity
<br><br>**Project Background**
<br>This project addresses the ongoing issue of anti-Asian hate and cultural misrepresentation, particularly in the context of Chinese identity and youth experience. While anti-Asian racism became more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, its roots run deep, dating back to the 19th century with discriminatory laws, exclusion acts, and violent events such as the 1871 Los Angeles Chinese Massacre. In both the United States and Canada, Asians have historically been marginalized, denied basic rights, and subjected to physical violence and systemic exclusion.

Despite progress over time, racism and cultural disrespect persist—especially in educational and social environments. As a Chinese Canadian student, I has personally experienced discrimination and mockery, including being targeted with racial slurs and ridiculed for wearing traditional clothing. These painful moments became the catalyst for selecting this issue as the focus of a social action project. The goal is to raise awareness, promote cultural representation, and create space for youth to feel proud of their heritage while actively combating prejudice in their communities.
<br><br>**Action Plan**
<br>To address the ongoing issue of anti-Asian discrimination and the misrepresentation of Chinese culture, this action plan proposes the creation of a Chinese Cultural Club at school. The goal is to foster a safe, inclusive, and engaging space where students can explore, share, and celebrate Chinese heritage through hands-on cultural activities such as calligraphy, traditional crafts, and storytelling.

The club aims to raise awareness, strengthen cultural identity, and promote understanding among peers. With a strong foundation in school—supported by executive members, a teacher advisor, and a strategic social media presence—the club is designed to grow sustainably. Fundraising through events and online engagement will help support the club's operations.

Short-term goals include successfully running the club for at least one semester and gathering feedback for continuous improvement. Long-term goals involve expanding the initiative beyond the school by partnering with organizations like the Asian Solidarity Fund, with the ultimate vision of transforming the club into a youth-led non-profit that combats Asian hate and promotes cultural representation across the broader community.

By combining personal experience, leadership, and cultural knowledge, this plan seeks to create lasting change through education, representation, and community engagement.
<br><br>**Evaluation**
The success of this initiative will be measured by the club’s ability to promote cultural appreciation, foster inclusivity, and challenge stereotypes surrounding Chinese culture. The club aims to serve as a welcoming space where students can celebrate cultural identity, share experiences, and engage in meaningful activities.

Evaluation will focus on both quantitative and qualitative metrics:
* Growth and engagement of club membership
* Fundraising efforts in support of anti-Asian hate awareness
* Member satisfaction and cultural impact, assessed through regular feedback surveys
* Semi-annual debrief sessions with executive members to reflect on progress and improve programming
A six-month review will be used as the first major checkpoint to assess outcomes against established goals. Key performance indicators will include membership numbers, event participation, and funds raised. Success will be defined by achieving (or approaching) these targets while creating a positive, culturally empowering environment for all involved.

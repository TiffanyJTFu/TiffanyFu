**Project Topic:** The Lack of Cultural Awareness in Markham: Challenges and Opportunities for Youth Engagement
<br><br>**Project Background**
This project was completed as part of the **Brown University Pre-College Program – Leadership and Social Change**, under the guidance of an assistant professor. The research focused on the issue of cultural awareness in Markham, one of Canada’s most diverse cities. Despite its multicultural population, the city continues to face challenges related to intercultural understanding, particularly among youth.

The project aimed to explore how the lack of cultural awareness impacts community cohesion and youth engagement. Using qualitative research methods such as surveys, interviews, and local case studies, the research identified key gaps in education and community interaction. The findings were presented in a capstone presentation to faculty and peers, along with recommendations for promoting inclusive practices and cross-cultural dialogue in local settings.

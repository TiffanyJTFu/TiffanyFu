**Innovation Project:** ICELERT
<br><br>**Problem**
<br>A problem that is faced by Canadians across the country stems from the natural, harsh winters. The freezing cold temperatures carry many consequences, such as the formation of ice on roads and sidewalks, large piles of snow, blurry and frozen windshields, and more. The vision issue can also cause Canadians to believe they are going slower than they actually are (ie. a 60 kph speed could make you feel like you’re going 30kph). As a result, many Canadians experience unexpected incidents, such as collisions, crashes, sidetracks, and ultimately congestion. The extra time and energy wasted on waiting in long lasting traffic, only results in an increased amount of fossil fuels and carbon emissions being released, yet there is still a decrease in efficiency compared to warmer temperatures. These accidents caused by the cold winters also put unfortunate Canadians in a situation where they may have to a replacement for their source of transportation (e.g. a new car), leading to unnecessary expenses and negative environmental impacts that follow – such as the disposal of materials which can lead to the leakage of toxic materials. 
<br>How might we prevent collisions in cars while still being sustainable

**PROBLEM**
<br>Heat generating car in some way
* **Stakeholders + Aspects**
<br>Those in the working industry that need to drive large distances
  * Truck Transporters: job requires hours on the road, and the faster they are able to travel faster clients 
  * Office workers: office workers need to wake up earlier to arrive to their workplaces on time
* **Government Methods of Mitigation**
  * Snow removal and de-icing: Municipal snow clearing programs ensure roads and sidewalks and bike lanes are plowed quickly after the snow falls - this is an issue because sometimes, these programs do not act quickly enough to be effective, causing people to be delayed in moving from place to place (eg. important meetings - Gideon’s example)
   * Salt/Sand/Brine treatments - Salt on roads is detrimental to transportation methods’ stability as it causes corrosion which impacts both vehicle and infrastructure integrity
   * Use of Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS) to monitor pavement temperatures, humidity and precipitation - has limited coverage and placement; maintenance and reliability issues; Lack of real-time responsiveness; Requires integration with other systems; high cost solution
   * Anti-icing methods done pre-snowfall to reduce accumulation and make plowing more efficient - timing is critical; weather condition uncertainty

<br>**STATS**
* In November 2021, when the Fraser valley and Sumas Prairie in British Columbia’s Lower mainland were overwhelmed by massive flooding. Metro Vancouver was cut off from the rest of Canada by road. Nothing could leave the port of Vancouver, massively impacting the supply chain, prairie farmers, manufactures, and many other businesses.
* About 18% of fatal collisions occurred during poor weather conditions in Canada in 2021
* About 30% of accidents occurred on wet, icy, or snowy roads, with about one-third of all accidents in Canada
* 29% of collisions were caused by environmental factors (unlisted)
* ~30% of Canadian collisions were caused by wet roads, snow or ice. (chatgpt)
* 1/3 of car collisions happen in winter in Canada (chatgpt)
* Approximately 30% of reported collisions happen on wet, snowy, or icy roads.
* According to Natural Resources Canada, fuel consumption can increase by approximately 1.3% on highways due to increased wind resistance alone.
* Colder temperatures can reduce fuel efficiency by 12-28% on urban commutes.
* Collisions drastically increase energy usage in vehicles because the kinetic energy of the cars is converted into other forms of energy during the impact, primarily heat and sound, and also through deformation of the vehicle's structure.
* Collisions are more prominent during winter in Canada due to hazardous road conditions, reduced visibility, and increased travel during the holiday season. Icy roads, especially black ice, and snowy conditions reduce tire traction, making it harder to stop or steer safely. Reduced daylight hours and inclement weather, like heavy snowfall, also impair visibility, making it challenging for drivers to react to hazards.
* In 2017, nearly 30 percent of collisions reported to the National Collision Database happened on wet, snowy or icy roads. One third happened in January, February, November and December
* Victoria, British Columbia, is generally considered the Canadian city with the least amount of snowfall and 232 reported incidents while Edmonton is generally one of the most snowfall 24,003 motor vehicle collisions in Edmonton

<br>**STEPS**
* Identify Weather-Related Hazards
  * Analyze collision data to determine which weather conditions (e.g. snow, freezing rain, fog, heavy rain) cause most accidents.
  * Map high-risk areas (intersections, highways, rural roads) with frequent weather-related incidents.
* Improve Road Maintenance and Response
  * Increase frequency and coverage of salting and plowing during snow or freezing rain.
  * Deploy real-time weather monitoring stations to inform rapid deployment of maintenance crews.
  * Implement brine pre-treatment strategies before snowfall or freezing rain to reduce ice formation.
* Enhance Driver Awareness and Communication
  * Use digital highway signs to display real-time weather and hazard warnings.
  * Integrate weather alerts with navigation apps  and local radio to inform drivers promptly.
  * Conduct seasonal public education campaigns on driving behaviour in specific weather conditions.
* Upgrade Road Infrastructure
  * Improve drainage systems to prevent pooling during heavy rain.
  * Install heated pavement technology or road surface treatments in critical zones to reduce ice build-up.
  * Enhance street lighting and reflective lane markings for reduced-visibility conditions like fog and heavy rain.
* Enforce Appropriate Speed and Safety Regulations
  * Implement variable speed limits adjusted to weather conditions using digital signs.
  * Increase penalties for reckless driving during hazardous weather.
  * Deploy more police patrols or automated enforcement in areas with high weather-related collision rates.
* Promote Vehicle Safety Standards
  * Encourage use of winter tires through rebates or mandatory regulations in winter months.
  * Promote regular vehicle checks (tire tread depth, windshield wipers, brake efficiency) before winter.
* Monitor, Evaluate, and Adapt
  * Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using accident and response data.
  * Adjust policies, resource allocation, and infrastructure planning based on evaluation results

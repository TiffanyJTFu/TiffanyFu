**Innovation Project:** ICELERT

 A problem that is faced by Canadians across the country stems from the natural, harsh winters. The freezing cold temperatures carry many consequences, such as the formation of ice on roads and sidewalks, large piles of snow, blurry and frozen windshields, and more. The vision issue can also cause Canadians to believe they are going slower than they actually are (ie. a 60 kph speed could make you feel like you’re going 30kph). As a result, many Canadians experience unexpected incidents, such as collisions, crashes, sidetracks, and ultimately congestion. The extra time and energy wasted on waiting in long lasting traffic, only results in an increased amount of fossil fuels and carbon emissions being released, yet there is still a decrease in efficiency compared to warmer temperatures. These accidents caused by the cold winters also put unfortunate Canadians in a situation where they may have to a replacement for their source of transportation (e.g. a new car), leading to unnecessary expenses and negative environmental impacts that follow – such as the disposal of materials which can lead to the leakage of toxic materials. 

How might we prevent collisions in cars while still being sustainable

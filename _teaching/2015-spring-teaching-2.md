Project Topic: Cross-cultural Education Methods and Adolescents' Physical and Mental Health
=====
<span style="font-size:2.5em;"><b>Project Background</b></span> 

In the context of globalization, increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between the educational practices of immigrant families and the physical and mental health of adolescents. Young people from immigrant backgrounds face unique challenges such as cultural conflict, identity issues, and the pressure to adapt to a new environment. These stressors can have significant impacts on their well-being, with reported cases of depression and even suicide. At the same time, immigrant parents also face difficulties in navigating parenting and supporting their children in a new cultural and social context.

These pressures should not be borne by individual families alone—they are societal challenges that require collective awareness and support.

To address this need, Leading Tomorrow, a non-profit organization, has launched a social research project titled “Cross-cultural Education Methods and Adolescents’ Physical and Mental Health.” The project aims to deepen understanding of how parenting and education styles within immigrant families affect adolescents’ mental health and social adaptability. By conducting this research, the project seeks to identify key factors influencing youth development, providing a scientific basis for more effective support strategies and interventions that can help immigrant adolescents thrive.

Project Topic: Cross-cultural Education Methods and Adolescents' Physical and Mental Health
=====
<span style="font-size:2.5em;"><b>Project Background:</b></span> 
In the context of globalization, the relationship between immigrant families' education methods and adolescents' physical and mental health has received increasing attention. Adolescents from immigrant families face unique challenges, including cultural conflicts, identity problems, and pressure to adapt to a new environment. These factors may affect their physical and mental health, and depression and even suicide incidents are reported from time to time; and immigrant parents also face challenges and pressures in how to cultivate and support their children in a new environment. These severe pressures should not be borne independently by each family, but should be cared for and faced by the society together.

Leading Tomorrow, a non-profit organization, has specially initiated and organized a social research project on "Cross-cultural Education Methods and Adolescents' Physical and Mental Health" to gain a deeper understanding of how the education methods of immigrant families affect adolescents' mental health and social adaptability. Through this survey, the key factors affecting adolescent growth can be revealed, providing a scientific basis for the formulation of more effective support strategies and intervention measures, thereby helping adolescents from immigrant families grow and develop better.
